Pi server source code.
This is the source code for my Apache web-server hosted on my raspberry pi, these files are all the files found in
the /var/www directory.
You can use these files if you have a linux server of some sort (like my raspberry pi) running Apache2.
Just use a secure file transfer protocol SFTP client (For OS X users I reccomend Fugu: 
http://sourceforge.net/projects/fugussh/files/) and copy all the files into your /var/www folder.
The only 2 files you don't need to copy are WebsiteBackgroundJPG and WebsiteBackgroundTIFF.
This only works assuming you already have Apache setup and you will only be able to access it locally
unless you port-forward.
